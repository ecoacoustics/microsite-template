{{< section/call-to-action >}}
The Plains Wanderer is critically endangered due to habitat loss, predation, and climate change. We're on a mission to train our AI to recognise their calls, and we need your help! By checking the tags our system has put on bird calls, you can help ensure they're correct. This helps us monitor their populations and habitats more effectively, contributing to conservation efforts.

        <h2>Why it matters</h3>
        <p>
            By helping identify bird calls, you're contributing to a growing
            library of acoustic data that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tracks how species respond to climate change</li>
            <li>Monitors ecosystem health after disasters</li>
            <li>
                Guides restoration efforts to ensure habitats don't just
                look right â€” they sound right, too
            </li>
